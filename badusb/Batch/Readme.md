# 🧠 HID Payload Batch Scripts

This repository contains a collection of **Batch scripts** intended for use in *HID-style attack scenarios* — where a USB device emulates a keyboard to quickly inject commands into a target machine.

These scripts are designed to be fast, simple payloads that **could be adapted** for use with BadUSB devices like **Rubber Ducky**, **Flipper Zero**, **Digispark**, or any other HID emulation platform.

## ⚠️ Not Tested for BadUSB Execution

These scripts were written as normal `.bat` files and have **not been tested** on actual BadUSB hardware.  
They haven’t been encoded into Ducky Script, tested for execution timing, or optimized for input delay quirks.

That said, I’ve included them here *in case they’re useful*, or if someone wants to modify and test them for real-world use.

> 🧪 *You’ll likely need to tweak them before using with any HID payload injector.*

## 💬 Why This Exists

Sometimes you just need quick and dirty payloads to:
- prototype ideas 💡
- experiment 🧪
- or break out of the copy-paste loop 🔁

These scripts are **rough**, **untested for BadUSB**, and **not guaranteed to work out of the box** — but they’re here anyway.

Use them however you see fit… within reason.
